# Urban Grocers – Product Delivery Application

Project developed as part of the **TripleTen Bootcamp**.  

---

## Project Description

Urban Grocers is a catalog-based product delivery platform. The goal of the project was to validate new back-end features, ensuring the proper functioning of endpoints related to customized kit management and delivery services. Error response behaviors (such as **400 Bad Request**), data limits, and business rules defined in the technical requirements were also verified.

## My Role

I worked on **API testing**, focusing on:

- Analyzing technical requirements and API documentation (**apiDoc**);  
- Creating **test checklists** covering both positive and negative flows;  
- Performing **API tests in Postman** (methods **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**);  
- Validating endpoints, such as:  
  - `/api/v1/kits/{id}/products`  
  - `/order-and-go/v1/delivery`  
- Checking item limits in kits and delivery calculation rules;  
- Reporting **bugs in Jira**, documenting: steps, expected and actual results, severity, and priority;  
- Preparing **test reports** with conclusions about the stability and performance of new API versions.
